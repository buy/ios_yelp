# Yelp App

This is a Yelp app for iOS as the [week 2 assignment](https://courses.codepath.com/courses/intro_to_ios/unit/2#!assignment) of CodePath.

Time spent: 6 hours

### Completed:

- [x] Table rows should be dynamic height according to the content height.
- [x] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints.
- [ ] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).
- [ ] The filters you should actually have are: category, sort (best match, distance, highest rated), distance, deals (on/off).
- [ ] The filters table should be organized into sections as in the mock.
- [ ] You can use the default UISwitch for on/off states.
- [ ] Clicking on the "Search" button should dismiss the filters page and trigger the search w/ the new filter settings.

### Optional:
- [ ] Infinite scroll for restaurant results
- [ ] Implement map view of restaurant results
- [ ] Implement a custom switch
- [ ] Distance filter should expand as in the real Yelp app.
- [ ] Categories should show a subset of the full list with a "See All" row to expand.
- [ ] Implement the restaurant detail page.
